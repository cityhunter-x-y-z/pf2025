/* The answer layer behind the /home-2.2 chat surface.
 *
 * This is a curated retrieval brain, not a language model: every sentence here
 * was written by hand from the case studies that already live in
 * src/pages/projects/. Intent matching is keyword scoring, and the "depth"
 * control in the prompt bar genuinely changes how much of an entry is
 * returned rather than just re-skinning the same paragraph.
 *
 * Swapping this for a real API later means replacing respond() with a fetch —
 * the block shapes it returns are what the UI renders, so nothing else moves.
